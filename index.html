            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Steve Jobs was born in 1955 and raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California. 
                Though he was interested in engineering, his passions as a youth varied. 
                After dropping out of Reed College, Jobs worked as a video game 
                designer at Atari and later went to India to experience Buddhism. In 1976 he helped launch Apple.</p>
